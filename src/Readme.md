# WorkAndPomodoroTimer


This application can be used to track your work time. Intention was to create this since I worked in an area of business where work time was not tracked automatically but one has to track it himself. I had the feeling of working much more than I finally entered as work time. 
Therefore, I created this application. Meanwhile, it also has a database connected to the application as well as the possibility to export the information about the worktime from the database into a csv format. One can do anything he wants with the export.

Upcoming features will be a pomodoro timer. The timer already works, but I have to think about an effective and nice visual implementation into the tool.
Enjoy, happy about feedback as well.
